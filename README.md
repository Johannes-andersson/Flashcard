## Features

- Add new flashcards to existing sets
- Review flashcards with the ability to see questions first, then answers
- Navigate between flashcards easily using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons
- Delete unwanted flashcards from a set
- Simple and user-friendly GUI using `tkinter`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with most Python installations)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Johannes-andersson/Flashcard.git
   cd Flashcard
Run the flashcard.py file to start the app:

bash
Copy code
python flashcard.py
Usage
When the app opens, select a flashcard set from the dropdown menu, or create a new set.
Add new cards by entering questions and answers.
Review flashcards by hitting "Review Cards," then navigate through the flashcards using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
During review, the app first displays the question. Hit "Next" to reveal the answer, and hit "Next" again to move to the next card.
You can delete flashcards that are no longer needed.
